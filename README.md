My solution to the webdev problem.

To install the dependencies:
First install pipenv using pip:
`pip install --user pipenv`
`pipenv install`
`python manage.py makemigrations`
`python manage.py migrate`

To run the servere
`python manage.py runserver`

The working of the site is quite intuitive, you can create a user and login. User can create posts, see the list of posts and see details of a particular post. I have a WYSIWYG editor, which makes adding rich text in the content much easier, but the statement said to add an image field explicitly, so I have done that as well, can be thought of a kind of "banner image".
